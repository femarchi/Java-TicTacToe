A simple Tic Tac Toe game for future AI study.

Default player behavior: chooses random place recursively as long as board is not filled.

Future improvements:

 *  AI's added as extended Player classes;
 *  Comments for better understanding of code;
 *  Choice of bigger boards (4x4, 5x5, etc...);
 *  User input option
 *  Simplification/Optimization using java libraries and other data structures (if necessary)
